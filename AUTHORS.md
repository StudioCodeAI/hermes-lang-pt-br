# Authors and provenance

This repository is the **canonical** pt-BR language pack for Hermes Agent: it is the one listed in
the curated plugin catalogue (`NousResearch/hermes-agent`, `plugin-catalog/hermes-lang-pt-br.yaml`),
and the only one that ships versioned releases.

## Who wrote what

- **Core and TUI** — mirror the `pt` locale bundled upstream (MIT, © Nous Research and its
  contributors), re-registered here as the real `pt-br` id so it wins over the `pt` / `pt-BR` alias.
- **Desktop** — original to this pack, grown out of the work in #92590 / commit `0bbc800f55e`. It is
  the largest surface (5,172 of 5,176 reference keys; the four remaining are arrays/structured values
  a text pack cannot carry).
- **@4nrry** — 85 European-Portuguese → Brazilian-Portuguese wording fixes (pack PR #3, merged as
  `dd9ec89`).
- **@henrickgu** — credited for an independent pack that reused the keys from #92590 and for a
  2,032-key wording comparison (pack PR #2). That pack is a separate, derivative project; it is not
  the catalogue entry and it is not a co-author of this one.

## Credit rules

1. A contribution merged as-is keeps its author and its commits (no anonymous squash).
2. Wording adopted from someone else's proposal gets a `Suggested-by:` trailer in the commit and a
   line in the changelog.
3. Derivative packs are welcome under the MIT license, but only this repository publishes the
   catalogue pin; version numbers and releases are ours.
